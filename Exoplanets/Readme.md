# Exoplanets
## About project:
The project was part of Object Programming classes which was created with one of my colleagues.

This is a JavaFX application which represents NASA data aquired from public REST API. It shows information about exoplanets, which type they are, amount of their
moons, relation between mass and density and much more.
