# Christmas_in_data_Dashboard
## About Project
This dashboard was created by me and two other colleagues during data visualisation classes.
During this project we've aquired data about for what we use our computers by Activity Watch application. This data is not available, because it's our private data.
This application counts the time of which app is in the higlighted window.

Data was colectd during our winter holidays in 2020 year.

Project was created using Java for data transfromation and JavaScript with html for Visualization
